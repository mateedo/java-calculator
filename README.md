# java-calculator

this is a java 2-line calculator i created in grade 10 for my IB personal project. run the java file on command line and input expressions you want calculated. the code will run infinitely until you type a certain character, or you might need to just terminate the program manually yourself.

program is not that efficient realistically considering it was my first coding project. maybe ill make an efficient code for it with Shunting-Yard algorithm
